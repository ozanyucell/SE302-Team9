# Hello!
* You can follow our design document while coding!

# NEEDS TO BE FIXED!
* Nothing for now.

# What you can work on:
  * An algorithm which is able to find relation between to nodes.
  * mergeTrees and deleteTree functions.
  * We need to be careful with exceptions. (Like a user entering his name in the age box.)

# What we did:
  * Implemented basic required backend classes.
  * Implemented a GUI.
  * File I/O working properly.
  * Software is now able to open ".tree" files.
  * Software is able to write ".tree" files as well.
