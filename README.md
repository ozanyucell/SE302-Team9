* You can follow our design document while coding!

# What you can work on:
  * We need to implement Tree, Relation and then TreeRelation classes.
  * We agreed on using Swift, so any of us can start working with its algorithms.
  * Since we won't be working with database, we will need to work with file I/O.

# What we did:
  * Implemented Person class.
