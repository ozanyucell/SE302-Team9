# Hello!
* You can follow our design document while coding!

# NEEDS TO BE FIXED!
* Nothing for now.

# What you can work on:
  * Relation algorithms are missing.
  * editTree, mergeTrees and deleteTree functions.
  * We need to implement GUIs for Tree creation and member adding.
  * Also, we need a GUI for printing out the tree.
  * We need to be careful with exceptions. (Like a user entering his name in the age box.)

# What we did:
  * Implemented basic required backend classes.
  * Implemented a GUI for main page.
  * File I/O working properly.
  * Software is now able to open ".tree" files. Tested on terminal. GUI is missing.
  * Software is able to write ".tree" files as well. Tested on terminal. GUI is missing.
